# Neovim configuration using Lazy
Note: this configuration is heavily inspired by the one of [Josean Martinez](https://www.josean.com/posts/how-to-setup-neovim-2024); with a few changes to make it work on Windows and some added features.

## Key features
* Full LSP configuration
* Tex formatting and preview (using [vimtex](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex) + SumatraPDF)
* git integration
* [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim) implementation
* Code linting and formatting
